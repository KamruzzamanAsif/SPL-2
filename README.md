# EmPower
Our tool, EmPower, is a user-friendly interactive learning tool to
provide autistic children with basic academics. To teach the students 
EmPower provides different lessons (on nouns, verbs, activities, and 
associations) concerning the different types of disabilities that 
necessitate additional requirements. There is an interactive Quiz 
based evaluation system and a system to monitor and track the learning
progress of students based on their eye gaze tracking.
